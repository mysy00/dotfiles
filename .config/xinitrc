# There are some small but important commands that need to be run when we start
# the graphical environment. I keep those commands in ~/config/xprofile because
# that file is run automatically if someone uses a display manager (login
# screen) and so they are needed there. To prevent doubling up commands, I
# source them here with the line below.

# Your default LARBS WM is determined in your `~/.profile` on login.  Here we
